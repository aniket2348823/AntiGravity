# [CRITICAL] – Sovereign Proof-of-Concept Report Template

**Vulnerability Name:** [e.g., Cross-Context Race Condition / Chained Auth Bypass]
**Severity:** CRITICAL (P1)
**Target Endpoint:** [e.g., https://api.target.com/v1/resource]
**Vector:** Distributed Ephemeral Swarm Execution (v60.0 Singularity Logic)

---

## 1. Executive Summary
A vulnerability was identified in the State-Machine Logic of the target application. Specifically, the `[Endpoint Name]` fails to maintain Transactional Integrity during high-concurrency periods. By utilizing a "Turbo Frame" burst via a distributed swarm of 50+ unique AWS IP addresses, the system successfully bypassed `[WAF/Rate-Limiter Name]` and exploited a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) flaw.

## 2. Exploit Evidence (Singularity Logs)

### A. The Doppelgänger Replay (Auth Bypass Proof)
The scanner performed a cross-session replay between three distinct authorization contexts.
*   **Context A (Admin):** Request to `/api/admin/config` (Status: 200)
*   **Context B (Standard User):** Replayed with User Token (Status: 200)
*   **Context C (Anonymous):** Replayed with No Token (Status: 200)
*   **SimHash Delta:** `HammingDistance(Admin, User) = 0` (Identical response structure confirmed).

### B. The Chronomancer Burst (Race Condition Proof)
The following log shows a single-use resource (Coupon/Credit) being redeemed multiple times within the same millisecond.

| Timestamp (ms) | Node IP (Rotated) | Payload | Response Code | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 14:02:01.001 | 34.212.x.x | `{"id": "SUMMER50"}` | 200 OK | Redeemed |
| 14:02:01.002 | 52.14.x.x | `{"id": "SUMMER50"}` | 200 OK | **REDEEMED (Exploit)** |
| 14:02:01.003 | 18.221.x.x | `{"id": "SUMMER50"}` | 200 OK | **REDEEMED (Exploit)** |

## 3. Impact Analysis
*   **Financial Integrity:** Unauthorized redemption of credits leading to direct financial loss.
*   **Authorization Collapse:** Standard users can access administrative configuration via direct object reference.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Historical "Zombie APIs" discovered via Wayback CDX mining leaked sensitive SQL debug traces.

---

## 4. Steps to Reproduce
1.  Authenticate as a Low-Privilege user.
2.  Capture the POST request to the target endpoint.
3.  Deploy the provided Ephemeral Swarm Manifest to AWS Lambda.
4.  Execute the `sovereign_worker` script targeting the endpoint with a concurrency factor of 50.
5.  Observe multiple success responses for a single-use action.

---

## 5. Recommended Remediation
*   **Atomic Transactions:** Implement row-level locking or Atomic operations (e.g., `UPDATE ... SET count = count - 1 WHERE count > 0`) at the database layer.
*   **Contextual Validation:** Enforce strict RBAC checks that validate the resource ownership against the Subject in the JWT/Session token for every request.
*   **Decommission Zombie Endpoints:** Implement a strict "Sunset Policy" for legacy API versions (v1, v0) and ensure they are unreachable from the public internet.
